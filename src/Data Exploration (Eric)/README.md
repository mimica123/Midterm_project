These files won't work as they are in this folder. They're here for organization purposes, but they all rely on the python files in the parent directory. Importing those files as they are from here may be possible, but it's not so straightforward that I figured it out immediately.

If I have time to return to this and restructure I may do so and remove this notice. But until then just move the file from this folder into src/ and run it from there.
